|cFFFFCD00Indication will show when somebody loots item from your list. This snatcher will receive message from you with urgent request to trade snatched item.

By default item list contains two type of AQ keys, but you can add some items or remove from the list, using the 'Custom options' tab. Also you can turn-off messaging or change the message in this tab.

You can modify load zones or conditions at 'Load' tab

Should work for all languages, but tested only on RU and EN locales.
